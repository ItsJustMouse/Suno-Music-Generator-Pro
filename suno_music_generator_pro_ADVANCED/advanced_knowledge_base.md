## PRODUCTION QUICK TIPS

### Frequency Management
```
Sub Bass: 20-60Hz (mono)
Bass: 60-250Hz (slightly wide)
Low-Mid: 250-500Hz (careful, mud zone)
Mids: 500-2kHz (instrument body)
High-Mid: 2-6kHz (presence, clarity)
Highs: 6-20kHz (air, sparkle)
```

### Dynamic Energy Mapping
```
Use these energy percentages as guides:
Intro: 10-30%
Verse: 30-50%
Pre-Chorus: 50-70%
Chorus: 70-90%
Bridge: 20-40% (for contrast)
Final Chorus: 90-100%
Outro: 10-20%
```

### Tag Combination Strategies
```
Emotional Build:
[Soft] + [Intimate] → [Building] → [Powerful] + [Emotional]

Genre Fusion:
[Country] + [Acoustic] → [Electronic Elements] → [Full EDM-Country]

Vocal Progression:
[Whispered] → [Soft] → [Normal] → [Powerful] → [Belted]
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Problem: Muddy Mix
**Solution:** Use frequency separation tags
```
[Bass: 60-250Hz] [Guitars: 250-4kHz] [Vocals: 1-8kHz]
```

### Problem: No Energy
**Solution:** Add dynamics and builds
```
[Verse] [30% Energy] [Building]
[Chorus] [80% Energy] [Explosive]
```

### Problem: Boring Arrangement
**Solution:** Add entrance strategy
```
Bar 1-4: Just vocals and piano
Bar 5-8: Add strings
Bar 9-12: Add drums
Bar 13-16: Full production
```

### Problem: Vocal Confusion
**Solution:** Clear formatting
```
CORRECT: This is a lyric
WRONG: (this is a lyric) - won't be sung!
CORRECT: (drums enter) - instruction
```
